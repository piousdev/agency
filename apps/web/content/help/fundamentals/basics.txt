# The basics

The Docs Marketing API provides programmatic access to Docs data and functionality, allowing developers to build custom features to do things like sync email activity and campaign analytics with their database, manage audiences and campaigns, and more.

To use the Docs API, you need a Docs account. What you can do with the API depends on what level of Docs plan you have. Once you have an account and are logged in, you can get an API key and begin making calls to the API.

## Using Docs

Whether you're managing your own campaigns, providing Docs services to your customers or clients, or writing a mobile app, the Docs Marketing API has features to manage and sync your contact data.

## API structure

The Docs Marketing API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

### Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.docs-marketing.com/v1/
```

### Authentication

The API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Docs Dashboard.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

### Request format

The API accepts JSON-encoded request bodies. You must include the appropriate `Content-Type` header in your requests:

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Response format

All responses are returned in JSON format. A successful response will include a `success: true` field and the requested data in a `data` field.
