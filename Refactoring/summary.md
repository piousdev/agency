## 🔄 Integration Flow

The platform operates as a unified system with these key integrations:

```
INTAKE → PROJECTS → WORK → FINANCIALS
   ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓
CLIENTS ← TEAM ← OVERVIEW (Dashboard)
```

**Example Flow**:

1. Client submits request via **Intake**
2. Request routed and approved, becomes project in **Projects**
3. Project broken down into tasks in **Work**
4. **Team** members assigned based on capacity and skills
5. Time tracked in **Work**, costs accumulated
6. Project completed, invoice created in **Financials**
7. Payment received, recorded against **Client**
8. All activity visible in **Overview** dashboard
