0 - Minimal to None. The task is already done, or requires virtually no effort (e.g., changing a single text label on a static page). Change a simple CSS color variable, update a documentation typo, close a duplicate ticket.

1 - Very Small / Trivial. Minimal CUE. The task is straightforward and typically can be completed in an hour or less with no dependencies. Update an existing unit test, add a basic validation message to an existing form field.

2 - Small / Straightforward. Low CUE. A simple task that might take a few hours to complete, involving a clear, defined path with little risk.Add a new field to an existing API endpoint, create a simple configuration file, implement a basic UI element that uses existing components.

3 - Moderate. Some CUE. The task has a clear path but might involve a few steps or minor collaboration; generally completable within a day or less of dedicated work.Implement a standard login form using an existing authentication service, create a new simple report based on an existing data structure.

5 - Larger / Manageable. Moderate CUE. The task is involved but still manageable within a few days. May involve integration with a known service or requires input from multiple team members (e.g., Design, QA).Build a new page that reuses existing layouts and components, integrate with a third-party API that has good documentation, add a new database table and simple CRUD operations.

8 - Complex / Requires More Resources. Significant CUE. The task involves several unknowns or requires careful coordination and testing across the team. Might take close to a week or more.Refactor a core feature with potential side effects, implement a complex search functionality, upgrade a major framework version, add robust error handling across an application section.

13 - Very Complex / High Uncertainty. High CUE. Involves significant unknowns, substantial dependencies, or requires research before implementation. These are often candidates to be broken down into smaller stories.Implement a new payment gateway from scratch, migrate an entire module to a new service, significant performance optimization that requires deep analysis.

20, 40, 100 - Extremely Large / Epic. Maximum CUE. These estimates indicate the item is too large for a single sprint and must be broken down into smaller, estimable stories. They are used to quickly identify major initiatives.Rebuild the website using a new technology stack, launch a new product line, a major system architecture overhaul.
